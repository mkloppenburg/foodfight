Foodfight (CS50x final project)

Foodfight is my final project for CS50x. Foodfight is a small clicking game, where you can earn fruit and kill other players by feeding them said fruit. It also contains a messaging system and simple player profile page.

The project was created so I could familiarise myself with Django, itâ€™s ORM, decorators and other things related I before had no experience in.
